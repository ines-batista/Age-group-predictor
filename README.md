# Age-group-predictor
Prediction of which is the main age group that accesses a website.

The present work proposes to determinate which is the main age group that accesses a
website. To do so, one should consider if it is younger than/ older than, to be able to
adapt the offer to the target audience. These data can’t be obtained directly (by asking a
question to the users), but through a set of characteristic data, such as the writing pace,
the sequence of clicks and double clicks, etc. With the due treatment of these data, it is
expected to obtain an approximate value of the age of the target public, so that the
publisher of the site can adapt the offer to visitors as much as possible.
